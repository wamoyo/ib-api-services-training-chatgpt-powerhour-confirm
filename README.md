## Getting the Lambda hooked up

Remember to work with devapi.innovationbound.com first, and deploy to development stage first.

1. First, add the appropriate **Methods, Headers**, and anything else you need in your Lambda code.
2. Go to the `ib` API Gateway in the AWS Console.
3. Add one or more new resources for the path you want.
4. **DO NOT Enable CORS** from API Gateway for any resources, it's handled in Lambda.
5. Add an **OPTIONS Method** and any other method you want in APIGateway (just to the final resource).
6. Use **Lambda Proxy Integratino** for all methods you need including OPTIONS.
7. Test things in the API Gateway console first!
8. **Deploy the API** now that it has the new resource and both methods.
9. Any new updates to the lambda will immediately take effect.
